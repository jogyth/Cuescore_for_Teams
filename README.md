# Cuescore for Teams
Based on a package with Vue.js, Vuex and VueRouter. Axios for API calls. 

Our team is way too small and irratic to justify a full Pro lisence. Furthermore we don't really play tournaments. When we do - they strech over a long period of time (several weeks) since we only have one table. We use Challenges to register the matches - and enter the ID into this system to track the progress of the tournament. 

This is pretty much dirty, quickly-put-together code and most of the variables have norregian names. You may have a look at the site here --> https://generalens-biljardklubb.netlify.com. 

Feel free to fork it and I'm happy to answer your questions if you'd like to manipulate your version.
